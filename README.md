# BBS Academic University Workspace
Template Repository

## Purpose
This repository serves as a **template for per-university academic research workspaces** within the BBS academic preparation initiative.

Each university participating in future collaboration will operate within its **own dedicated repository**, based on this template.

## Relation to Academic Core
This workspace is derived from the BBS Academic Core:
https://github.com/BBS-contact/bbs-academic-core

The Academic Core defines:
- ethical principles,
- structural boundaries,
- governance rules.

This repository implements **local academic research activities only**, without modifying the Core.

## Intended Use
This workspace is intended for:
- academic research,
- controlled experimentation,
- testing conceptual models,
- preparing academic reports.

It is **not** intended for production use, deployment, or real-world implementation.

## Repository Ownership
Each instantiated university repository:
- is managed jointly with the participating academic institution,
- operates within a defined research scope,
- retains responsibility for its own experiments and reports.

No other university may modify or access this workspace unless explicitly authorized.

## Lifecycle
This repository represents a **time-bound academic research workspace**.

It may be:
- archived after completion,
- extended into further phases,
- referenced for academic publication.

It does not represent a permanent operational system.
